## Project Description 프로젝트 설명:
This project analyzes path optimization in Seoul's subway network using various shortest path algorithms in a graph network. Seoul Metropolitan Subway Network is extremely dense and many operators such as Seoul Metro, Seoul Metro 9, KORAIL, Shinbundang Line, Uijeongbu Light Rail, Everland Light Rail, and more. With more lines to be opened, the passenger ridership is expected to increase. Finding the shortest path is crucial in a dense network like the Seoul Metropolitan Subway Network because passengers need to go from one place to another as quickly as possible. Path optimization in public transportation systems is very crucial.
